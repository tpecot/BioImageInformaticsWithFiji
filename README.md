# BioImageAnalysisWorkshop
This is a 5 sessions workshop about bioimage analysis. 

For each session, a pdf describes the background required to understand the session topic and methods to addess it. Links to video tutorials are also available to see how to use ImageJ/Fiji to process images with the presented methods. The images used in the tutorials are available in the ImageExamples folders. A doc file in the same folders gives their location in the Internet.
